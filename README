To get started, you'll need devIL (IL and ILU) and nVidia Texture Tools installed as shared libraries.
Then, hopefully, getting up and running is as simple as "make".

My apologies for the state of the code; this was never really intended to see the light of day, 
and it needs plenty of work.

/// Setting up prereqs //

First things, you'll need AT LEAST the following:
cmake, build-essential, and lib*-dev (e.g. libpng-dev) for each filetype you want to support

Next, download both Nvidia texture tools and the devIL libraries:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openil/DevIL-1.7.8.tar.gz
http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/downloads/detail?name=nvidia-texture-tools-2.0.8-1.tar.gz

	////////////////////////////
	/// Nvidia texture tools ///
	////////////////////////////
	
	After unzipping the tarball with "tar xvf nvidia-texture-tools-2.0.8-1.tar.gz", change to your new folder with cd nvidia-texture-tools.
	
	In this directory, type the following:
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	
	/////////////
	/// DevIL ///
	/////////////
	
	Follow the same instructions as above for unzipping and getting to the right directory, then type:
	$ ./configure --enable-ILU --with-nvtt=no
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	
If, after compilation, you get the error:
	./VTFnix: error while loading shared libraries: libIL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
	
First, make sure /usr/local/lib is listed in the file /etc/ld.so.conf (or one of it's includes), then run sudo /sbin/ldconfig
